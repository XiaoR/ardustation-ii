# Ardustation 2 GCS #
_**optimized for Arduplane 2 and Arducopter 2 with MAVLink and antenna tracker support**_

This is based upon the original Ardustation code and ArdustationPS code.  Automatic and manual antenna tracking has been added with auto detection of platform type from the Mavlink heartbeat.

Note - This code will not work on Ardustation Mega. This code is compatible only with the original Ardustation with ATMEGA328.
